# Vatsim Events Map (Unofficial)

## Overview
This map serves as an alternate to the 2D official vatsim events map. It offers a more visually responsive interface with the ability to filter by event day.

## Project Architecture

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

To run the development server locally (ensure executed within `vatsim-events-map` directory):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the website.
